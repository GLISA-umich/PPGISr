### Run an example map
PPGISr comes with a sample map that loads as default. The example map provides an area of Minnesota and three land cover categories to choose from. 

```{r basic, eval=FALSE}
PPGISr::run_app()
```

### Create your own categorise 
You can also suggest which categories of land cover you would like to map.

```{r categories, eval=FALSE}
PPGISr::run_app(mapping_categories = c("Trees", 
                                       "Flowers",
                                       "Water"))
```
