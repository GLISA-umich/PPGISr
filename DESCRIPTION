Description: PPGIS refers to spatially explicit methods for capturing and
    using spatial information in participatory planning processes,
    decision-making, and scientific inquiry. Applications include
    identifying participant preferences for future land use and
    management, pinpointing valued locations for conservation, and design
    of urban landscapes to name a few. However, the technical hurdles
    associated with its setup have often limited its use to small-scale
    experimental exercises. Reducing barriers to using PPGIS may offer new
    ways for public engagement and data collection that enhance our
    capacity to pursue decision-making, especially when it can be done
    online.
